# Contributing

Contributions are extremely welcome. Feel free to add issues and pull requests.

Before contributing code changes, keep the following in mind:

* Make sure to write tests for new code. TDD is encouraged.

* The `vcf` package uses [testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) to write its tests. To keep consistency in the code base, new tests should also be written with it.

* All tests must pass, both existing and new.
